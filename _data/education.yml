    During my degree at IIIT Delhi, I learnt lots of key skills such as team work and project management. Although
    we mainly focused on software development and the principles of programming I use a lot of these skills to
    my advantage in my day to day work.

    While at my Uni, I spent a lot of my free time teaching "Code Classes". I love to teach and being a firm believer of 
    "Knowledge increases with sharing" definitely helps in that regard.
